Will reinforce that microcontrollers are about measurement and control. Control systems are the heart of robotics and these lessons will develop this theme. E.G. 

1. Let the robot take control Make a program that keeps a given distance from an object.Learn how to deal with fluctuations 
2. **Algorythims for Life** Learn PID control of the motors

This may also further develop the concept of abstraction. The art of delegating functionality lower down the food chain.  Possibly good to introduce the Serial API with the programming Interface here.
