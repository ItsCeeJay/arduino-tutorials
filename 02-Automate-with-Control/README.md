###Control and Automation - The Heart of Robotics

Robots are special because they operate in the **real world**.  They have *actuators* to act in the world and therefore change environments or do meaningful work. They also have *sensors* to gain information about the world. 

The magic happens in the middle. What can be done with the information gathered from sensors? How should the actuators in the system be commanded to bring results that you want?

Control Systems are the heart of robotics and exist as our programs and algorithms. They are the **Artificial Intelligence** from which the robot can perform autonomous and useful work. This section develops the knowledge that microcontrollers are about measurement and control. Using input to contol a desired state will be explored from a simple example to a more complex control system. E.G. 

1. Let the robot take control Make a program that keeps a given distance from an object.Learn how to deal with fluctuations 
2. **Algorythims for Life** Learn PID control of the motors

This may also further develop the concept of abstraction. The art of delegating functionality lower down the food chain.  Possibly good to introduce the Serial API with the programming Interface here.
