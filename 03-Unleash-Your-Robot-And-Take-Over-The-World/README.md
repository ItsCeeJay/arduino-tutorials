####Pre-requisites

At this point the learner should have a good understanding of control systems and using the robots hardware.  The next step is to complete an API for controlling the robot entirely with Python from the raspberry pi.


####Section Overview
The first sections will be further developed before this section is developed further. Here are some initial suggestions:

####IDEAS: 

This section fulfills the abstaction of the microcontroller. Doing the lower level work in controlling and taking measurements from the system.  This frees up the Raspberry Pi to do higher level programming and computing. Machine Vision etc. What could demontrate this?

- Setting up a web interface to control the robot remotely.  This could be over the local network or eventually over the internet. 

####What should be covered?
How to create an API to the robot over serial and control the robot using Python. This is at the level that @ Bristol need so I'm keen to get it this far soon.

This is a further demonstration of abstraction.
