##SECTION 1 
This index outlines the Pibot robot course.  There are there parts: 


Each step to robot mastery will have a physical **doing** element, a **knowledge** elements as well as a programming **skill** element. This way *physical computing*, *electronics* and *programming*, are learned at the same time. 

###Gaining Robot Powers: Bringing your Robot to Life

1. **Let there be light!** Wire up an LED and make it blink! *What is a MicroController?*
2. **Controll your robots brightness** First steps in speaking robot (aka learning programming in C)
3. **The machines can do your work** Let the code control brightness. *Learn first machine signals*
4. **Switch on** Let humans be in control.*Learn how to make a function*
5. **Show us your moves** Give your robot muscles. *converting data to action*
6. **Learning to move** Control high power motors.*Making changes in the world* 

###Harmony. Coordinate your robot powers 
**Not yet defined**   
-Incorporate the remaining hardware and sensors.( Stepper Motor, Neopixels & Ultrasound)
-Introduce Libraries and using code in a modular way.e.g.
7. **Dancing** Creating code modules. *Use all your robot powers together*
-Learn the benefit of libraries and modular design. Turn previous lessons (leds, servos, DC motors) into libraries and make sketch that combines all of them into one.
8. **Sensing the world** Measure and distance. *Filtering data to remove errors*
 Other Things to measuring Temperature -Potential Additions: -Measuring Humidity , -3 Axis accelerometers -IMU -Digital compass -GPS modules -Encoders

###3: Control is key .
**Not yet defined**  
--Clarify that microcontrollers are about measurement and control. Control systems are the heart of robotics.  Intoduce controll. Systems
9.**Let the robot take control** Make a program that keeps a given distance from an object.*Learn how to deal with fluctuations*
10.**Algorythims for Life** Learn PID control of the motors 

##4: Set your robot free! Automate and Remote Control
**Not yet defined** 
Covers how to create an API to the robot over serial.  This can then give all its control, command, measurement capabilities over to the Raspberry Pi.  The raspberry Pi can then use Python scripting.  This is a further demonstration of abstraction.
