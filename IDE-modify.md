#Modify the Arduino IDE 
Here we'll explain how the Arduino IDE can be modified to work with the PiBot.
####Approach 
We wanted to modify the IDE to simplify its options and add some unique styling.
- create a unique PiBot board configuration and make it the IDE 's default instead of the *UNO*.. **Boards.txt**
- Create a custom way to program the microcontroller using a **RasPi ISP**
- Replace the default **Examples** directory with support files for the learning system
- Replace the default **Libraries** directory with ones specific to the PiBot.
- **preference.txt** Here we'll customise some settings
