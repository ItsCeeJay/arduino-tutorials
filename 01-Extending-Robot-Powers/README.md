However I do know that this section will:

- Incorporate the remaining hardware and sensors.( Stepper Motor, Neopixels & Ultrasound)
- Introduce Libraries and using code in a modular way.e.g. 

7. Dancing Creating code modules. Use all your robot powers together 
- Learn the benefit of libraries and modular design. Turn previous lessons (leds, servos, DC motors) into libraries and make sketch that combines all of them into one. 
8. Sensing the world Measure and distance. Filtering data to remove errors Other Things to measuring Temperature 
- Potential Additions: -Measuring Humidity , -3 Axis accelerometers -IMU -Digital compass -GPS modules -Encoders


###Incorporate Serial 

 Create a serial interface and use this to control code over the serial interface. This is the groundwork for developing a full API between the Raspberry Pi and the Arduino Microcontroller in the final section.  The real power of having a microcontroller in the system is that all lower level hardware can be abstracted and taken care o f by the microcontroller.  The Raspberry Pi can then focus on higher level code and operation (e.g. multimedia, camera, and image processing, machine vision, python, web applications, networking and links to the internet)
