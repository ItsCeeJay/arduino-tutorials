However I do know that this section will:

- Incorporate the remaining hardware and sensors.( Stepper Motor, Neopixels & Ultrasound)
- Introduce Libraries and using code in a modular way.e.g. 

7. Dancing Creating code modules. Use all your robot powers together 
- Learn the benefit of libraries and modular design. Turn previous lessons (leds, servos, DC motors) into libraries and make sketch that combines all of them into one. 
8. Sensing the world Measure and distance. Filtering data to remove errors Other Things to measuring Temperature 
- Potential Additions: -Measuring Humidity , -3 Axis accelerometers -IMU -Digital compass -GPS modules -Encoders
